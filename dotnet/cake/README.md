## C# Make or Cake

It's like Gradle that uses Groovy, Cake uses C# to write build script.

This is a real world build example: [aws-sam-cli generated dotnet build script](../../aws/sam/hello-dotnet/build.cake).

My tests are not focused on build scripts. I want to test its dependency management in case you need to write some code.
